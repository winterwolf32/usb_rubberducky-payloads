A script used to encrypt all documents with the Fernet algorithm.

**Category**: Execution

## Description

A script used to encrypt all documents with the Fernet algorithm.

The main use case for that payload is to have a quick tool to encrypt each of your own documents while saving the key so that you can decrypt everything later.

I see it as a big red movie button for emergencies, the encryption speed is pretty fast and saving the key is pretty much immediate so I would imagine that as the sense of use. Remember that in the Python document you can also find the decryption function that will allow you to return to the original documents at any time, obviously via the saved key so make sure you have properly saved a copy before continuing.

With the new changes only if the key saving is successful you will be able to continue with the encryption. This is a security measure applied for users of the payload.
