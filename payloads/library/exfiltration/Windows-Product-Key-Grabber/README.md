This payload sends you the target PC's Windows product key via Dropbox.

## Process

1. Detects when the USB Rubber Ducky is ready and whether the target operating system is Windows.
2. Opens a Windows Run dialog box.
3. Executes a hosted PowerShell script that performs the following actions:
- Clears the history of the Windows Run menu.
- Recovers Windows product key from target PC.
- Sends the Windows product key of the target PC to a file in your Dropbox.

## Prerequisites

First of all, you need to set up an appropriate Dropbox exfiltration "App" to obtain your "app key", "app secret" and "refresh token", which you can do by following the quick tutorial available [here](https://codeberg.org/PlumpyTurkey/Ducky-Utilities/src/branch/main/PowerShell-Functions/Send-ToDropbox). Once you get them, you need to download the "script.ps1" file for this payload and edit it to add the values for your "App". Once you've done that, all you need to do is host the modified file and make it downloadable from a URL that you set as an option for this payload.

> [!WARNING]
> If you're using Dropbox to host your script, make sure the download link for your script ends with "dl=1" and not "dl=0".
