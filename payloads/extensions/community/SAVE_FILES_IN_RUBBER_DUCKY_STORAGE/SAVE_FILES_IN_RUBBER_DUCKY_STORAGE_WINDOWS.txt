    REM VERSION 1.0

    REM_BLOCK Documentation
        This extension is used to save one or more files through the USB Rubber Ducky storage.

        TARGET:
            Windows 10/11

        USAGE:
            Insert this extension when you have one or more files that you want to save in your USB Rubber Ducky.

        CONFIGURATION:
            Set #DRIVER-LABEL variable with the correct Label of your USB Rubber Ducky considering that the default value is 'DUCK'.

            Set #FLAG-SINGLE-FILE with TRUE if you want to save just one file.
            In this case you will need to specify the file path within the #SINGLE-PATH variable OR, in case the exact path to the file you can only acquire it at runtime and so via the powershell, use in the powershell the $fileToSavePath variable to capture this path.
                i.e. in DuckyScript EXTENSION
                    DEFINE #SINGLE-PATH C:\Users\Aleff\Downloads\photo.png
                i.e. in PowerShell before extension
                    $fileToSavePath = "C:\Users\Aleff\Downloads\photo.png"

            Set #FLAG-SINGLE-FILE FALSE if you want to send multiple files.
            In this case in the PowerShell you will have to create the variable $fileToSavePaths, which is an array of strings that should contain the list of paths related to the files you want to save.
                i.e. in PowerShell before extension:
                    $fileToSavePaths = @(
                        "C:\Users\Aleff\Downloads\photo.png",
                        "C:\Users\Aleff\Downloads\document.pdf",
                        "C:\Users\Aleff\Downloads\song.mp3"
                    )
